					<span>Mercury</span>—the smallest planet in our solar system and
					nearest to the Sun—is only slightly larger than Earth's Moon. Its
					surface is covered in tens of thousands of impact craters. From the
					surface of Mercury, the Sun would appear more than three times as
					large as it does when viewed from Earth, and the sunlight would be as
					much as 11 times brighter. Despite its proximity to the Sun, Mercury
					is not the hottest planet in our solar system— that title belongs to
					nearby Venus, thanks to its dense atmosphere. .
